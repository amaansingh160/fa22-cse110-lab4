1. 3 because the list length is 3. 
2. 150 because it got 300 and multiplied by discount which is 0.5
3. 150 because it got the discounted price which was 150 then multiplied 100 and divided by 100
4. The function returns 50, 100, 150 because it multiplies each price by the discount and finalprice doesn't do anything 
5. The code causes an error because i is let and console.log(i) is outside of that block
6. The code causes an error because console.log(discountedPrice) is outside of the block it got instantiated.
7. 150 because finalPrice was instantiated in the same block so console.log(finalPrice) meaning it can print it
8. 50, 100, 150 because discounted was instantiated in the same block as return
9. The code causes an error because i is let and console.log(i) is outside of that block
10. 3 because length was instantiated before the block and is in the same block as console.log(length)
11. 50, 100, 150 because discounted was instantiated in the same block as return
12. 
    A. student.name
    B. student["Grad Year"]
    C. student.greeting()
    D. student["Favorite Teacher"].name)
    E. student.courseLoad[0]
13. 
    A. 32 because integers map to their exact string representation
    B. 1 because 3 maps to a integer and subtracts 2 from it and I get 1
    C. 3 because 3 plus nothing is 3. 
    D. 3null It changes null to null to a string and adds two strings
    E. 4 true maps to 1 so 1 plus 3 is 4
    F. 0 becuause false maps to 0 and null is 0 so it is 0
    G. 3undefined becuase it changes undefined to a string representation adds two strings
    H.NaN becuase 3 maps to a integer and undefined to integer

14. DSA
    A. true because it turns 2 to an integer and compares it 
    B. false because it compares the 2 string and 12 string
    C. true because it changes the string into an integer and compares it
    D. false because it compares types
    E. false because it maps true to 1 and compares with 2, and 1 doesn't equal 2.
    F. ture becasue true is a boolean and Boolean(2) is the boolean value true

15. == compares the value and === compares the types
17. 2, 4, 6 these are the values because it gets the array and goes through each item and calls the dosomething function which multiplies it by 2. This is then pushed into newArr.
19. 1 4 3 2
